PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

Covid-19 recently One of the most neglected areas to concentrate on has come under scrutiny due to the pandemic: Healthcare management. 
Patient duration of stay is one crucial statistic to monitor and forecast if one wishes to increase the effectiveness of healthcare management in a hospital, even if there are many use cases for data science in healthcare management.
At the time of admission, this metric aids hospitals in identifying patients who are at high LOS-risk (patients who will stay longer).Once identified, patients at high risk for LOS can have their treatment plans improved to reduce LOS and reduce the risk of infection in staff or visitors.Additionally, prior awareness of LOS might help with planning logistics like room and bed allotment.
Let's say you were employed by Health Man, a non-profit company whose goal is to administer hospitals in a competent and effective manner, as a data scientist.
The objective is to correctly anticipate the length of stay for each patient on an individual basis so that hospitals may utilise this information to better allocate resources and operate.There are 11 different categories for the length of stay, ranging from 0 to 100 days.
